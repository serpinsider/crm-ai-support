# Brooklyn Bot AI - Intelligent SMS Customer Service

AI-powered SMS customer service bot that uses Claude (Anthropic) to automatically respond to customer texts via OpenPhone.

## Overview

This bot sits between your customers and your team:
- **Customer texts your OpenPhone number** â†’ Webhook fires
- **AI analyzes message** â†’ Decides if it can handle it
- **AI responds automatically** OR **Flags for human** team member

Your team keeps using OpenPhone's interface normally - they'll only see messages the AI couldn't handle.

---

## What It Does

### Auto-Responds To:
âœ… Pricing questions ("How much for 3bd/2ba?")  
âœ… Service explanations ("What's in a deep clean?")  
âœ… Availability questions ("When can you come?")  
âœ… Policy questions ("Do I need to be home?")  
âœ… General questions about services  
âœ… Booking guidance  

### Flags For Human:
ðŸš¨ Complaints or quality issues  
ðŸš¨ Payment disputes  
ðŸš¨ Rescheduling requests  
ðŸš¨ Complex custom requests  
ðŸš¨ Angry/upset customers  
ðŸš¨ Anything it's not confident about

## OpenPhone Webhook Setup

### 1. Deploy Your Server

Deploy to Render, Railway, or any hosting service:

**Render.com (Recommended):**
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect Render to your repo
3. Create new Web Service
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy
6. Note your URL (e.g., `https://brooklyn-bot-ai.onrender.com`)

**Or use ngrok for local testing:**
```bash
ngrok http 8000
# Copy the https URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
```

### 2. Configure OpenPhone Webhook

1. Go to OpenPhone dashboard
2. Settings â†’ Integrations â†’ Webhooks
3. Click "Add Webhook"
4. Configuration:
   - **URL:** `https://your-server.com/webhook/incoming-message`
   - **Events:** Select `message.created`
   - **Phone Number:** Select your TEST number only
5. Save

### 3. Test It

Send a text to your test OpenPhone number:
```
"How much for a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom deep clean?"
```

Check your server logs - you should see:
```
ðŸ“© Incoming Message Webhook
ðŸ“± From: +1234567890
ðŸ’¬ Message: How much for a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom deep clean?
ðŸ¤” Decision: âœ… Auto-respond
ðŸ¤– Generating AI response...
ðŸ’­ AI Response: Hey! For a 3bd/2ba deep clean...
ðŸ“¤ Sending AI response...
âœ… AI response sent successfully!
```

---

## Testing Guide

### Phase 1: Test Without Sending (Safe)

Use the test endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/test-ai-response \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "How much is a standard clean?",
    "conversationHistory": []
  }'
```

This shows you what the AI would respond WITHOUT actually sending the SMS.

### Phase 2: Test With Your Own Phone

1. Send texts to your test OpenPhone number
2. Watch server logs
3. Receive AI responses
4. Verify quality

**Test these scenarios:**

âœ… **Pricing question:**  
Text: "How much for 2 bed 2 bath?"  
Expected: AI gives price breakdown

âœ… **Service question:**  
Text: "What's included in deep clean?"  
Expected: AI explains what's included

âœ… **Complaint (should flag):**  
Text: "My cleaner broke my vase!"  
Expected: NO auto-response, stays in inbox

âœ… **Complex request:**  
Text: "I need someone tomorrow at 7am with special supplies"  
Expected: May or may not respond (test it)

### Phase 3: Test With Team Member Phones

Have your assistants text the number with real customer-style questions.

### Phase 4: Go Live (Optional)

Once confident:
1. Change webhook to your LIVE OpenPhone number(s)
2. Set `ENABLE_AUTO_RESPONSE=true` in production
3. Monitor closely for first few days
4. Adjust system prompt as needed

---

## Configuration

### Business Knowledge

Edit `business-knowledge.js` to update:
- Service descriptions
- Pricing information
- Policies
- Common Q&A

### System Prompt

Edit the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `server.js` to change:
- AI agent personality
- What it can/can't handle
- Response style
- Business rules

### Decision Logic

Edit the `shouldAutoRespond()` function to change:
- Which keywords trigger human escalation
- Rate limiting rules
- Business hours enforcement
- Message count limits

---

## Safety Features

### 1. Rate Limiting
Max 10 responses per customer per hour (configurable)

### 2. Escalation Keywords
Auto-flags if message contains:
- complaint, terrible, awful, worst
- refund, lawsuit, sue, lawyer
- angry, upset, damaged, broke, stolen

### 3. Response Validation
Checks if AI response is:
- Not too short (<10 chars)
- Not too long (>800 chars)
- No placeholder text

### 4. Conversation Limit
Flags if customer has sent >5 messages in conversation

### 5. Business Hours
Optionally only respond during business hours

### 6. Manual Override
Set `ENABLE_AUTO_RESPONSE=false` to disable all auto-responses

---

## Monitoring

### Server Logs

Watch logs in real-time:
```bash
# If running locally
npm run dev

# If on Render
View logs in Render dashboard
```

### OpenPhone Dashboard

- Conversations marked "done" = AI handled
- Conversations still "open" = Needs human attention

### Cost Tracking

Check Claude usage at https://console.anthropic.com/settings/usage

Typical costs:
- ~$0.003-0.01 per customer conversation
- $5 credit = ~500-1000 conversations

---

## Customization

### Change AI Model

In `server.js`, change model name:
```javascript
model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620'  // Current (best quality)
// or
model: 'claude-3-haiku-20240307'     // Cheaper, faster, less smart
```

### Add Business-Specific Logic

Example: Check if customer has existing booking
```javascript
// In shouldAutoRespond function
const customer = await lookupCustomerByPhone(message.from);
if (customer && customer.hasActiveBooking) {
  // Customer has booking, handle differently
}
```

### Integrate With Your CRM

```javascript
// In incoming message handler
const customer = await fetchFromHubspot(customerPhone);
// Pass customer data to AI for personalized responses
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Webhook not firing

**Check:**
- Is webhook URL correct in OpenPhone?
- Is server running and accessible?
- Is webhook configured for correct phone number?
- Check OpenPhone webhook logs

### Problem: AI responses are bad

**Fix:**
- Update SYSTEM_PROMPT with better examples
- Add more business knowledge
- Adjust temperature (lower = more consistent)
- Review logs to see what it's struggling with

### Problem: Too many human escalations

**Fix:**
- Review escalation keywords (may be too aggressive)
- Increase confidence threshold
- Update decision logic

### Problem: Not enough human escalations

**Fix:**
- Add more escalation keywords
- Lower confidence threshold
- Increase validation strictness

### Problem: Rate limit hit

**Fix:**
- Increase MAX_RESPONSES_PER_HOUR
- Or customer is spamming (good that it's blocked)

---

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Render (Recommended)

```bash
1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect Render to repo
3. Set environment variables
4. Deploy
```

Free tier: Sleeps after 15min inactivity (fine for testing)  
Paid tier: $7/mo, always on

### Option 2: Railway

Similar to Render, good alternative

### Option 3: Heroku

Classic option, $7/mo minimum

### Option 4: Your Own VPS

If you have a server, just:
```bash
pm2 start server.js
```

## Support

Questions? Issues? Check:

---

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` file to git (already in .gitignore)
- Keep API keys secret
- Use separate test/production API keys if possible
